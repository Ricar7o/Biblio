== Biblio App

Biblio is an app built on Ruby on Rails that acts as a digital bookshelf.
Users can see a catalog of all the books that exist in the app or if they sign in,
all of their books. They can upload a new book using a file for the cover. If it is
unknown, using the ISBN the app connects to Goodreads to grab the rest of the information.
